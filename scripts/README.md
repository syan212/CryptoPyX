# Scripts

These are scripts for my convenience

benches.sh - runs benchmarks thrice, and compares them

install.sh -  Installs dev and doc dependencies and installs the actual package

analyse_csv.py - Prints out average of field from csv

ci.sh - runs CI locally. Note that this will not be the same as the github CI,
        as it only runs it on your specific OS and architecture
