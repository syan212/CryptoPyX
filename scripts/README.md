# Shell scripts

These are shell scripts for my convenience

pytest.sh - runs benchmarks thrice, and compares them
wheel.sh - Uninstalls cryptopyx, builds the new wheel for your system, and then installs the new wheels
CI.sh - runs CI locally. Note that this will not be the same as the github CI, 
        as it only runs it on your specific computer
